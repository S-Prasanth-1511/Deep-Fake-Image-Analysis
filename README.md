# Deep-Fake-Image-Analysis
Deep Fake Image Analysis is a machine learning-based web application designed to detect AI-generated (deepfake) images by analyzing inconsistencies in the eye region. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification and provides real-time predictions with confidence scores through a Flask-based interface.
